		// , sign here a & b are same datatype integer so thats why we write like this
	int c =a+b;
	// here upper line u can write value 10 & 50 in place of a& b because these 10&50 these value
	//is assigning to a& b  so we can write int c=10+50; and output is same as before
	System.out.println("c=  " + c);
	//when both data types are different + sign work as separator here
	//"c" is a string and next c is a integer i.e why here +sign work as
	//separator
		
	// here i am right example to doing addition of two bytes
	byte v=16;
	byte p=15;
	//byte his boundary range is -128to127 so you take value more than this
	//here we doing addition of two byte
	 //byte g= v+p; when we go to add two byte it show error(because we use opertor +sign is the answer 
	// of the addition is always output int
	int g=v+p;// it is the right syntax for add pf two bytes number then it not shows error
	System.out.println(g);
